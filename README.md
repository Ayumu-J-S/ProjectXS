# ProjectXS
This is the project from CSCI2356 (Mobile App Development) in winter 2021 term. This browser based application is made to help students in the school of architecture at Dalhousie University learn about the cost of heating a house, and various factors that affect it. The page that we created is under insulation in the dropdown menu, and if any other selection is chosen, the page will give a warning and reload.

GRAPHS dropdown menu and READOUTS dropdown menu are graded out and do not have funcitonality (this was a requested behaviour), but everything else has some funcitnalities.
